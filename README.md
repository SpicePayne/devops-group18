## Workflow

1. Identify the user story that will be developed in the next sprint.
2. Create a new sprint in Zube and assign the selected user story to it.
3. Move the chosen user story into the Ready column on the Zube board.
4. Add any additional task cards needed for the user story and order them by priority.
5. Pull the most recent version of the develop branch.
6. Create a new feature branch for the selected user story or task.
7. Select the task to begin working on in Zube and update its status.
8. Complete the development work for the selected task.
9. Build the project and generate the JAR file once the feature is complete.
10. Test and update the Docker configuration using Travis CI to verify everything builds correctly.
11. Update the feature branch with the latest changes from the develop branch.
12. Test the updated feature branch to ensure functionality remains intact.
13. Merge the completed feature branch back into the develop branch.
14. Repeat steps 5 through 13 until the sprint deliverables are finished.
15. When the release is ready, merge the develop branch into the release branch and create the release.
16. Merge the release branch into both the master and develop branches.
17. Close the sprint after all tasks have been completed and reviewed.
