# Team Working Agreement  
### SET08803 Group 18 Assesment – Population Information System  

This document describes how our team will work together and what standards we will follow during development.  
It includes our **Definition of Ready (DoR)** and **Definition of Done (DoD)** for all user stories, tasks, and project work.

## 1. Purpose  
We agree to follow these rules to make sure our work is clear, consistent, and meets the coursework requirements for SET08803.  
All team members are responsible for following this agreement during each sprint.

## 2. Definition of Ready (DoR)  
A user story or task is considered **Ready** when the team can start working on it without confusion or missing information.

A story is **Ready** when:  
- [ ] The task or story has a clear title and description.  
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are written and easy to understand.  
- [ ] The story can be completed within one sprint.  
- [ ] Dependencies such as data files, tools, or access are available.  
- [ ] There are no blockers preventing work from starting.  
- [ ] The team has discussed the story and understands what needs to be done.  
- [ ] The story has been estimated and prioritised in the backlog.  
- [ ] The story links to the sprint goal or project requirement.  

If any of these points are missing, the story stays in the backlog until it becomes Ready.

## 3. Definition of Done (DoD)  
A user story, feature, or task is considered **Done** when all quality, testing, and documentation requirements are complete.

A story is **Done** when:  
- [ ] The code is finished, compiles, and runs without errors.  
- [ ] Code has been reviewed by at least one teammate and approved.  
- [ ] The story’s acceptance criteria are fully met.  
- [ ] Unit or integration tests have been written and pass successfully.  
- [ ] The CI/CD pipeline shows a successful (green) build.  
- [ ] Code is merged into the main branch through a pull request (not directly committed).  
- [ ] Documentation and comments are updated (README, code comments, or usage notes).  
- [ ] Any database or data changes are tested and documented.  
- [ ] The feature integrates correctly with other parts of the system.  
- [ ] The work supports the project’s assessment goals and can be demonstrated.  
- [ ] No open bugs, missing tests, or unresolved comments remain.  
- [ ] The team agrees that the story meets the Definition of Done and moves it to “Done” on the board.

## 4. Team Responsibilities  
- **Scrum Master:** Ensures DoR and DoD are followed and helps remove blockers.  
- **Developers:** Follow coding, testing, and review standards.  
- **Product Owner:** Confirms acceptance criteria and approves completed stories.  
- **All team members:** Attend sprint meetings, update the board, and communicate blockers early.

## 5. Communication Rules  
- Daily stand-ups are short (10–15 minutes).  
- All work is tracked on the sprint board (Zube or GitHub Projects).  
- Important discussions and decisions are recorded as comments on issues or pull requests.  
- Each sprint ends with a review and a short retrospective.

## 6. Updates to this Agreement  
The team may review and update this agreement at the end of any sprint if improvements are needed.

**Approved by the team:**
