# USE CASE #12: View top N populated cities in the world (City Report)

## CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION
**Goal in Context**
As a Data Analyst, I want to view the top N most populated cities worldwide so that I can identify the largest global cities and analyze global urbanization trends.

**Scope**
World Population Reporting System

**Level**
Primary task

**Preconditions**
* The database (world.sql) is connected and loaded.
* The user is logged into the system interface (CLI or GUI).
* City population data exists and is accurate.
* The user understands that "N" represents the number of top records to retrieve.

**Success End Condition**
The system successfully generates and displays a list of the top N cities in the world ordered from largest to smallest population.

**Failed End Condition**
Invalid or non-numeric input for N, no data returned, or database query fails.

**Primary Actor**
Data Analyst

**Trigger**
The user selects the City Report then Top N (World) option and enters a numeric value for N.

## MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO
1. The user opens the World Population Reporting System.
2. The system displays the main dashboard with available report categories.
3. The user selects City Report.
4. The system displays a submenu for Report Type (All, Continent, Region, Country, District, Top N).
5. The user selects Top N (World).
6. The system prompts the user to enter the number of top cities to display (e.g., "10").
7. The user enters a valid integer value for N.
8. The system executes a SQL query on the city table to retrieve the top N cities sorted by population in descending order.
9. The system formats and displays the report in the following columns: **City Name, Country Code, District, Population**
10. The user reviews the report, optionally exporting or saving it.

## EXTENSIONS
