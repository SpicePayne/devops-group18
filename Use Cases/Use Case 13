# USE CASE #13: View top N populated cities in a continent (City Report)

## CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION
**Goal in Context**
As a Data Analyst, I want to view the top N populated cities within a specific continent so that I can compare major cities across different continents and analyze regional urban growth patterns.

**Scope**
World Population Reporting System

**Level**
Primary task

**Preconditions**
* The database (world.sql) is connected and loaded.
* Valid continent names exist in the database.
* The user is logged into the system interface (CLI or GUI).
* City and country data are correctly linked.
* The user understands that "N" represents the number of top cities to retrieve.

**Success End Condition**
The system successfully generates and displays a list of the top N cities in the specified continent, ordered from largest to smallest population.

**Failed End Condition**
Invalid continent name, invalid value for N, or database connection/query failure prevents report generation.

**Primary Actor**
Data Analyst

**Trigger**
The user selects the City Report then Top N (By Continent) option and enters both the continent name and the desired N value.

## MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO
1. The user opens the World Population Reporting System.
2. The system displays the main dashboard with report categories.
3. The user selects City Report.
4. The system displays a submenu for Report Type (All, Continent, Region, Country, District, Top N).
5. The user selects Top N (By Continent).
6. The system prompts the user to enter the continent name (e.g., "Asia").
7. The user enters a valid continent name.
8. The system then prompts the user to enter a numeric value for N (e.g., "10").
9. The user enters a valid integer for N.
10. The system executes a SQL query joining city and country tables to filter cities belonging to the specified continent and limits the result to the top N by population.
11. The system sorts results in descending order by population.
12. The system displays the report in the following columns: **City Name, Country Name, Continent, District, Population**
13. The user reviews or exports the report as needed.

## EXTENSIONS
* **6a.** User enters an invalid or misspelled continent name, System displays: "Invalid continent name. Please try again."
* **8a.** User enters a non-numeric or invalid N value; System displays: "Please enter a valid number for N."
* **10a.** Database query fails, System logs the error and displays: "Unable to retrieve data. Check database connection."
* **11a.** No results found, System displays: "No city data available for the specified continent."

## SUB-VARIATIONS
* The report can be exported in CSV or PDF format, or displayed as an on-screen table.
* The user may optionally include country codes in the results.
