# USE CASE #5: View the top N most populated countries in a continent (Country Report)

## CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION
**Goal in Context**
As a Data Analyst, I want to see the top N most populated countries within a continent so that I can identify and compare the key countries contributing most to the continent's total population.

**Scope**
World Population Reporting System

**Level**
Primary task

**Preconditions**
* The database (world.sql) is connected and loaded.
* Valid continent names exist in the database.
* The user is logged into the system interface (CLI or GUI).
* A valid integer value (N) is provided by the user.

**Success End Condition**
The system successfully generates and displays the top N countries within the specified continent sorted by population in descending order.

**Failed End Condition**
Invalid continent name, invalid N value, database query fails, or no results returned.

**Primary Actor**
Data Analyst

**Trigger**
The user selects the Country Report then Top N (Continent) option and enters the desired continent name and number of results (N).

## MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO
1. The user opens the World Population Reporting System.
2. The system displays the main dashboard with report options.
3. The user selects Country Report from the available options.
4. The system displays a submenu for Report Type (All, Continent, Region, Top N).
5. The user selects Top N (Continent).
6. The system prompts the user to enter a continent name (e.g., "Africa") and a numeric value for N (e.g., 10).
7. The user enters a valid continent name and integer value.
8. The system validates both inputs.
9. The system executes a SQL query joining relevant tables to filter countries within the specified continent, limiting the results to the top N by population.
10. The system displays the formatted report in the following columns: **Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, Capital**
11. The user reviews or exports the report for analysis.

## EXTENSIONS
* **6a.** User enters an invalid or misspelled continent name, System displays: "Invalid continent. Please check the spelling or try again."
* **6b.** User enters a non-numeric or negative N value; System displays: "Invalid entry. Please enter a positive whole number."
* **9a.** Database connection fails, System logs the error and displays: "Unable to retrieve data. Please check database connection."
